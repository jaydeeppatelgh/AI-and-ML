# Smart Bundle AI Agent

Smart Bundle AI is a lightweight e-commerce personalization agent that suggests product bundles based on a customer's current cart or viewed product IDs. It uses co-purchase history to recommend relevant additional items, improving Average Order Value (AOV) and enhancing the shopping experience.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Recommends bundles using historical co-purchase data
- Real-time suggestion via a web interface
- Simple and modular Flask backend
- Easily extendable with ML models or APIs
